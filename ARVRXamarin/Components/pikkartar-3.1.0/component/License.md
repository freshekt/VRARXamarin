will have obtained all necessary consents from the End user to the collection,
use, processing, transmission and/or disclosure of such information. In

transmitted. The aforesaid is applicable to any information irrespective of such
information qualifying as “personal data” or not. You are aware that under the
EU privacy regime you need to meet in particular the following requirements:
(a) Ask for consent before the app starts to retrieve or place information on
the device, i.e., before installation of the app. Such consent has to be freely
given, specific and informed;
(b) ask for granular consent for each type of data the app will access; at
least, if accessed, for the following categories: Location, Contacts, Unique
Device Identifier, Identity of the data subject, Identity of the phone, Credit
card and payment data, Telephony and SMS, Browsing history, Email, Social
networks credentials and Biometrics;
(c) be aware that consent does not legitimize excessive or disproportionate data
processing;
(d) provide well-defined and comprehensible purposes of the data processing in
advance to installation of the app, and not change these purposes without
renewed consent;
(e) provide comprehensive information if the data will be used for third party
purposes, such as advertising or analytics;
(f) allow users to revoke their consent and uninstall the app, and delete data
where appropriate;
(g) respect the principle of data minimization and only collect those data that
are strictly necessary to perform the desired functionality; take the necessary
organizational and technical measures to ensure the protection of the personal
data You process, at all stages of the design and implementation of the
application (privacy by design);
(h) provide a single point of contact for the users of the application. Provide
a readable, understandable and easily accessible privacy policy, which at a
minimum informs users about: who they are (identity and contact details), what
precise categories of personal data the app wants to collect and process, why
the data processing is necessary (for what precise purposes), whether data will
be disclosed to third parties (not just a generic but a specific description to
whom the data will be disclosed), what rights users have, in terms of withdrawal
of consent and deletion of data;
(i) enable app users to exercise their rights of access, rectification, erasure
and their right to object to data processing and inform them about the existence
of these mechanisms;
(j) define a reasonable retention period for data collected with the app and
predefine a period of inactivity after which the account will be treated as
expired;
(k) with regard to apps aimed at children: pay attention to the age limit
defining children or minors in national legislation, choose the most restrictive
data processing approach in full respect of the principles of data minimization
and purpose limitation, refrain from processing children's data for behavioural
advertising purposes, either directly or indirectly and refrain from collecting
data through the children about their relatives and/or friends.
##### 9.5 If any consent from the End User to the collection, use, processing,
transmission and/or disclosure of such End User Data is denied or withdrawn, You
